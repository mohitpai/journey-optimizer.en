[Read more](../building-journeys/general-events.md#events-specific-time)
* In-app channel configuration prerequisites have been updated with a note about the usage of a custom Dataset preference merge policy. [Read more](../in-app/inapp-configuration.md)

* Additional recommendations have been added about the usage of the **Read Audience** activity. [Read more](../building-journeys/read-audience.md#must-read)
* The Get started with Adobe Experience Platform audiences page has been improved with a list of audience generation methods. [Read more](../audience/about-audiences.md)
* Best practices have been added when choosing an endpoint to target using a custom action. [Read more](../action/about-custom-action-configuration.md)
* An note has been added to notify users that events cannot be fired from external systems using an API. [Read more](../building-journeys/testing-the-journey.md#important-notes)

## November 2023 {#nov-2023}

* The guardrail that limits all custom actions has been changed from 150,000 calls over 30 seconds to 300,000 calls over one minute. In addition, the default capping no longer applies to each endpoint. It is now performed per host and per sandbox. For example, on a sandbox, if you have two endpoints with the same host (eg: `https://www.adobe.com/endpoint1` and `https://www.adobe.com/endpoint2`), the capping will apply for all endpoints under the adobe.com host. "endpoint1" and "endpoint2" will share the same capping configuration and having one endpoint reach the limit will have an impact on the other endpoint.
