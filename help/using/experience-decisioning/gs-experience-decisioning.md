## What is Experience Decisioning {#about}

>[!AVAILABILITY]
>
>The experience decisioning feature is currently available as a beta to select users only. To join the beta program, contact Adobe Customer Care.

Experience Decisioning simplifies personalization by offering a centralized catalog of marketing offers known as 'decision items' and a sophisticated decision engine. This engine leverages rules and ranking criteria to select and present the most relevant decision items to each individual.

These decision items are seamlessly integrated into a wide range of inbound surfaces through the new code-based experience channel, now accessible within Journey Optimizer campaigns.

**Limitations:**

* Decision policies are available for use in code-based experience campaigns only.
* For now, frequency capping is not available in Experience Decisioning.

## Experience Decisioning key steps {#steps}

The main steps to work with Experience Decisioning are as follows:

1. **Configure custom attributes**: Tailor the decision items' catalog to your specific requirements by setting up custom attributes into the catalog's schema.

1. **Create decision items** to show to your targeted audience.

1. **Organize with collections**: Use collections to categorize decision items based on attribute-based rules. Incorporate collections into your selection strategies to determine which collection of decision items should be considered.

1. **Create decision rules**: Decision rules are used in decision items and/or selection strategies to determine to whom a decision item can be shown.

1. **Implement ranking methods**: Create ranking methods and apply them within decision strategies to determine the priority order for selecting decision items.

1. **Create selection strategies**: Build selection strategies that leverage collections, decision rules, and ranking methods to identify the decision items suitable for displaying to profiles.

1. **Embed a decision policy into your code-based campaign**: Decision policies combine multiple selection strategies to determine the eligible decision items to display to the intended audience.
