# Export datasets to cloud storage locations {#export-datasets}

Journey Optimizer allows you to establish a live connection with cloud storage locations in order to export the content of your datasets.

By periodically exporting your data, you can ensure that you have a complete and up-to-date record of your customer interactions, making it readily available for reporting, archival, or data analysis purposes.

## Available cloud storage destinations {#destinations}

You can export datasets to 6 cloud storage destinations which are accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Destinations]** menu, in the **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** tab.

## Main steps to export datasets {#main-steps}

The main steps to export a dataset to a cloud storage location are as follows:

![](assets/dataset-export-process.png)

Detailed information on each step is available in Adobe Experience Platform documentation: [Export datasets to cloud storage destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/activate/export-datasets.html).

1. **Setup your cloud storage destination**. If you have not done so already, connect to a cloud storage destination from the destinations catalog. [Learn how to create a new destination connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/connect-destination.html#setup)

    <!--![](assets/dataset-export-setup.png)-->

1. **Select the cloud storage destination** where you want to export your datasets. In the destinations catalog, click the **[!UICONTROL Export datasets]** button on the desired card and select the connection to use.

    <!--![](assets/dataset-export-destination.png)-->

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If you are using Adobe Journey Optimizer along with Real-Time Customer profiles, destination cards will display an "Activate" button, allowing you to both export datasets and activate audiences for this destination, depending on the permissions you have enabled.

1. **Select the dataset(s)** that you want to export to the selected destination. [Learn more on Journey Optimizer datasets available for exporting](#datasets)

    <!--![](assets/dataset-export-dataset-selection.png)-->

1. **Schedule the export** of your dataset. Specify when the export should start and at which frequency it should occur.

    <!--![](assets/dataset-export-schedule.png)-->

1. **Review and confirm the export** by checking the summary that displays at the end of the configuration.

    <!--![](assets/dataset-export-review.png)-->

Once the export is complete, the content of your dataset is deposited on your cloud storage location according to the schedule you have configured.
