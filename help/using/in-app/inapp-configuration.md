# In-app channel prerequisites {#inapp-configuration}

## Delivery prerequisites {#delivery-prerequisites}

For the In-app messages to be delivered correctly, the following settings must be defined:

* In the [Adobe Experience Platform Data Collection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/overview.html){target="_blank"}, make sure you have a datastream defined such as under the **[!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Platform]** service you have the Adobe Experience Platform Edge and **[!UICONTROL Adobe Journey Optimizer]** option enabled.

    This ensures that the Journey Optimizer inbound events are correctly handled by the Adobe Experience Platform Edge. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/datastreams/configure.html){target="_blank"}

* In [Adobe Experience Platform](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/home.html){target="_blank"}, make sure you have the default merge policy with the **[!UICONTROL Active-On-Edge Merge Policy]** option enabled. To do this, select a policy under the **[!UICONTROL Customer]** > **[!UICONTROL Profiles]** > **[!UICONTROL Merge Policies]** Experience Platform menu. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/merge-policies/ui-guide.html#configure){target="_blank"}

    This merge policy is used by [!DNL Journey Optimizer] inbound channels to correctly activate and publish inbound campaigns on the edge. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/profile/merge-policies/ui-guide.html){target="_blank"}
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >When using a custom **[!UICONTROL Dataset preference]** merge policy, make sure to add the **[!UICONTROL Journey Inbound]** dataset within the specified merge policy.

The In-app channel is now configured. You can start sending In-app messages to your users.

## Content experiment prerequisites {#experiment-prerequisites}

To enable content experiments for In-app channel, you need to make sure the [dataset](../data/get-started-datasets.md) used in your In-app implementation [datastream](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/datastreams/overview.html){target="_blank"} is also included in your reporting configuration.

In other words, when configuring experiment reporting, if you add a dataset that is not present in your web datastream, web data will not display in the content experiment reports.

Learn how to add datasets for content experiment reporting in [this section](../campaigns/reporting-configuration.md#add-datasets).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The dataset is used read-only by the [!DNL Journey Optimizer] reporting system and doesn't affect data collection or data ingestion.

If you are **not** using the following pre-defined [field groups](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/tutorials/create-schema-ui.html#field-group){target="_blank"} for your dataset schema: `AEP Web SDK ExperienceEvent` and `Consumer Experience Event` (as defined in [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/platform-learn/implement-web-sdk/initial-configuration/configure-schemas.html#add-field-groups){target="_blank"}), make sure to add the following field groups: `Experience Event - Proposition Interactions`, `Application Details`, `Commerce Details`, and `Web Details`. These are needed by the [!DNL Journey Optimizer] content experiment reporting as they are tracking which experiments and treatments each profile is participating in.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adding these field groups doesn't impact the normal data collection. It is additive only for the pages where an experiment is running, leaving all the other tracking untouched.
