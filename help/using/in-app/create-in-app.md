# Create an In-app message {#create-in-app}

>abstract="Efficiently control your Triggers by selecting the specific events and criteria that will activate your messages. With the Rule builder, users can define precise conditions and values. When these conditions are met, they initiate a series of actions, including the delivery of in-app messages."

You can add an In-app message in a campaign or in a journey. Follow the steps detailed below to create an In-app message in both contexts.

Note that In-app messages are not impacted by the user's choice to opt-in or opt-out of push notifications at the operating system.

>[!TAB Add an In-app message to a journey]

To add an In-app message in a journey, follow these steps:

1. Open your journey, then drag and drop an **[!UICONTROL In-app]** activity from the **[!UICONTROL Actions]** section of the palette.

    When a profile reaches the end of their journey, any in-app messages displayed to them will automatically expire. For that reason, a Wait activity is automatically added after your In-app activity to ensure proper timing.

    ![](assets/in_app_journey_1.png)

1. Enter a **[!UICONTROL Label]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** for your message.

1. Choose the [In-app surface](inapp-configuration.md) to use.

    ![](assets/in_app_journey_2.png)

1. You can now start designing your content with the **[!UICONTROL Edit content]** button. [Learn more](design-in-app.md)

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Edit triggers]** to choose the event(s) and criteria that will trigger your message. Rule builders enable users to specify criteria and values that, when met, trigger a set of actions, such as sending an in-app message.

    ![](assets/in_app_journey_4.png)

    1. Click the event drop-down to change your Trigger if needed.
