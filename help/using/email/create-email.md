## Check alerts {#check-email-alerts}

As you are designing your messages, alerts are displayed in the interface (on top right of the screen) when key settings are missing.

![](assets/email_journey_alerts_details.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you do not see this button, no alert has been detected.

The settings and elements checked by the system are listed below. You will also find information on how to adapt your configuration to resolve the corresponding issues.

Two types of alerts can happen:

* **Warnings** refer to recommendations and best practices, such as:

    * **[!UICONTROL The opt-out link is not present in the email body]**: adding an unsubscription link into your email body is a best practice. Learn how to configure it in [this section](../privacy/opt-out.md#opt-out-management).

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >Marketing-type email messages must include an opt-out link, which is not required for transactional messages. The message category (**[!UICONTROL Marketing]** or **[!UICONTROL Transactional]**) is defined at the [channel surface](email-settings.md#email-type) level and when [creating the message](#create-email-journey-campaign) from a journey or a campaign.

    * **[!UICONTROL Text version of HTML is empty]**: do not forget to define a text version of your email body, as it will be used when HTML content cannot be displayed. Learn how to create the text version in [this section](text-version-email.md).

    * **[!UICONTROL Empty link is present in email body]**: check that all the links in your email are correct. Learn how to manage content and links in [this section](content-from-scratch.md).

    * **[!UICONTROL Email size has exceeded the limit of 100KB]**: for optimal delivery, make sure the size of your email does not exceed 100KB. Learn how to edit email content in [this section](content-from-scratch.md).

* **Errors** prevent you from testing or activating the journey/campaign as long as they are not resolved, such as:

    * **[!UICONTROL The subject line is missing]**: email subject line is mandatory. Learn how to define and personalize it in [this section](create-email.md).

    <!--HTML is empty when Amp HTML is present-->

    * **[!UICONTROL The email version of the message is empty]**: this error is displayed when the email content has not been configured. Learn how to design email content in [this section](get-started-email-design.md).

    * **[!UICONTROL Surface doesn't exist]**: you cannot use your message if the surface you have selected is deleted after the message creation. If this error occurs, select another surface in the message **[!UICONTROL Properties]**. Learn more on channel surfaces in [this section](../configuration/channel-surfaces.md).

>[!CAUTION]
>
>To be able to test or activate the journey/campaign using the email, you must resolve all **error** alerts.

## Check and send your email

Once your message content has been defined, you can use test profiles to preview it, send proofs and control its rendering in popular desktop, mobile and web-based clients. If you inserted personalized content, you can check how this content is displayed in the message, using test profile data.

To do this, click **[!UICONTROL Simulate content]** then add a test profile to check your message using the test profile data.

![](assets/email_designer_edit_simulate.png)

Detailed information on how to select test profiles and preview your content is available in the [Content Management](../content-management/preview-test.md) section.

When your email is ready, complete the configuration of your [journey](../building-journeys/journey-gs.md) or [campaign](../campaigns/create-campaign.md), and activate it to send the message.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To track the behavior of your recipients through email openings and/or interactions, make sure that the dedicated options in the **[!UICONTROL Tracking]** section are enabled in the journey's [email activity](../building-journeys/journeys-message.md) or in the email [campaign](../campaigns/create-campaign.md).<!--to move?-->
