# List collection qualifiers {#list-tags}

Collection qualifiers (previously known as "tags") allow you to better organize and sort through your offers. For example, you could label your Black Friday offers with the "Black Friday" collection qualifier. You can then use the search functionality in the Offer Library to easily locate all of the offers with that collection qualifier.

Collection qualifiers can also be used to group offers together into collections. For more information, see the tutorial on [creating collections](../../../offer-library/creating-collections.md).

You can view a list of all collection qualifiers within a container by performing a single GET request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API.

**API format**

```http
GET /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/tags?{QUERY_PARAMS}
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for persistence APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps` |
| `{QUERY_PARAMS}` | Optional query parameters to filter results by. | `limit=2` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET 'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/dps/tags?limit=2' \
-H 'Accept: *,application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
-H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
-H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
-H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

## Using query parameters {#using-query-parameters}

You can use query parameters to page and filter results when listing resources.

### Paging {#paging}

The most common query parameters for paging include:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `q` | An optional query string to search for in selected fields. The query string should be lowercase and can be surrounded by double quotes to prevent it from being tokenized and to escape special characters. The characters `+ - = && \|\| > < ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ \" ~ * ? : \ /` have special meaning and should be escaped with a backslash when appearing in the query string. | Website JSON |
| `qop` | Applies AND or OR operator to values in q query string param. | `AND` / `OR` |
| `field` | Optional list of fields to limit the search to. This param can be repeated like so: field=field1[,field=field2,…] and (path expressions are in the form of dot separated paths such as _instance.xdm:name) | `_instance.xdm:name` |
| `orderBy` | Sort results by a specific property. Adding a `-` before title (`orderby=-title`) will sort items by title in descending order (Z-A). | `-repo:createdDate` |
| `limit` | Limit the number of collection qualifiers returned. | `limit=5` |

**Response**

A successful response returns a list of collection qualifiers that are present within the container you have access to.
