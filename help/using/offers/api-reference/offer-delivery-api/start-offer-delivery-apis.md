# Get started with offer delivery APIs {#about-decisioning-apis}

You can deliver offers using either the **Decisioning** or the **Edge Decisioning** API. Additionally, the **Batch Decisioning** API allows you to deliver offers to all profiles in a given audience in one call. The offer content for each profiles in the audience is placed in an Adobe Experience Platform dataset where it is available for custom batch workflows.

In this page, you will find information on specific functionalities that are available with the **Decisioning** and **Edge Decisioning** APIs. While both allow you to deliver offers to your customers, we recommend using the **Edge Decisioning** API whenever possible for inbound use cases and to ensure better latency and throughput on your platform.

For more information on how to work with the APIs, refer to these sections:
* [Decisioning API](decisioning-api.md)
* [Edge Decisioning API](edge-decisioning-api.md)
* [Batch Decisioning API](batch-decisioning-api.md)

## Manage access to a container {#manage-access-to-container}

A container is an isolation mechanism to keep different concerns apart. The container ID is the first path element for all repository APIs. All decisioning objects reside within a container.

An administrator can group similar principals, resources, and access permissions into profiles. This reduces the management burden and is supported by [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). You must be a product administrator for Adobe Experience Platform in your organization to create profiles and assign users to them. It is sufficient to create product profiles that match certain permissions in a one-time step and then simply add users to those profiles. Profiles act as groups that have been granted permissions and every real user or technical user in that group inherits those permissions.

Given administrator privileges, you can grant or withdraw permissions to users through the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/){target="_blank"}. For more information, see the [Access control overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/access-control/home.html){target="_blank"}.

### List containers accessible to users and integrations {#list-containers-accessible-to-users-and-integrations}

**API format**

```http
GET /{ENDPOINT_PATH}?product={PRODUCT_CONTEXT}&property={PROPERTY}==decisioning
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for repository APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/` |
| `{PRODUCT_CONTEXT}` | Filters the list of containers by their association to product contexts. | `acp` |
| `{PROPERTY}` | Filters the type of container that is returned. | `_instance.containerType==decisioning` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X GET \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/?product=acp&property=_instance.containerType==decisioning' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {API_KEY}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {IMS_ORG}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {SANDBOX_NAME}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns information regarding decision management containers. This includes an `instanceId` attribute, the value of which is your container ID.

        }
    }
}
```

## Edge Decisioning API capabilities {#edge}

**Unique request for experience events and decisioning requests**

With the Edge Decisioning API, you can send in one single request the experience event itself along with the decisioning request, rather than having two different requests.

For example, if a customer visits your website, the request will include the experience event (the customer's visit to the page), and get an offer back to populate the visited page.

**Context data storage into Adobe Experience Platform**

Context data refers to data that you only know at the time you want an offer back. For example, the color of the purchased article, the weather at the time of the purchase, etc.

When passing context data with an Edge Decisioning API request, data is stored into the Adobe Experience Platform profile, allowing future reuse. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>In order for the context data to be stored, you need to have a dedicated XDM schema configured.

**Frequency capping counter update**

If frequency capping has been enabled for some of your offers to define how often their capping count is reset, the counter is updated and available in an Edge Decisioning API decision in less than 3 seconds. [Learn how to add constraints to an offer](../../offer-library/add-constraints.md)

## Decisioning API capabilities {#decisioning}

The functionalities listed below are only available with the Decisioning API. If you need to leverage one of them to meet your requirements, use the Decisioning API. Otherwise, we recommend using the Edge Decisioning APIs.

* **Offer content and characteristics**: you can choose not to return the content and characteristics of an offer using a dedicated option.
* **Offer metadata**: enable an option to return the metadata of an offer.
* **Merge policy**: use in your request a different merge policy from the one associated to your sandbox.
* **Decisioning events and frequency capping**: block decisioning events from being counted by any frequency capping that happens.
* **Duplicate propositions**: enable an option not to deduplicate propositions.
