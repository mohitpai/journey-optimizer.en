# Deliver offers using the Edge Decisioning API {#edge-decisioning-api}

## Getting started & prerequisites {#edge-overview-and-prerequisites}

The [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html#video-overview) is a client-side JavaScript library that allows Adobe Experience Cloud customers to interact with the various services in the Experience Cloud through the Experience Platform Edge Network.

The Experience Platform Web SDK supports querying the personalization solutions at Adobe, including Decision Management, allowing you to retrieve and render personalized offers that you have created using APIs or the Offer Library. For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation on [creating an offer](../../get-started/starting-offer-decisioning.md).  

There are two ways to implement decision management with the [Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html#video-overview). One way is geared towards developers and requires knowledge of websites and programming. The other way is using the Adobe Experience Platform user interface to set up offers which only requires a small script to be referenced in the header of the HTML page.

Refer to the Adobe Experience Platform documentation on [decision management](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/personalization/offer-decisioning/offer-decisioning-overview.html#enabling-offer-decisioning) for more information on how to deliver personalized offers using Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK.

## Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK {#aep-web-sdk}

Platform Web SDK replaces the following SDKs:

* Visitor.js
* AppMeasurement.js
* AT.js
* DIL.js

The SDK did not combine these libraries and is a new implementation from the ground up. To use it, you must first follow these steps:

1. Ensure your organization has the appropriate permissions to use the SDK and you have configured the permissions correctly. 

    <!-- For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation on using the [Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](). -->

1. [Configure your datastream](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/datastreams.html) within the Data Collection tab in your account in the Adobe Experience Cloud.

1. Install the SDK. There are multiple methods of doing so, which are covered on the [Install the SDK page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/installing-the-sdk.html). This page will continue with each different method of implementation. 

In order to use the SDK, you must have a [schema](../../../data/get-started-schemas.md) and a [datastream](../../../data/get-started-datasets.md) defined.

<!-- ****TODO - Configure schema**** -->

To personalize offers, you must separately configure your personalization/profiles. 

<!-- Refer to the [doc](www.link.com) for detailed instructions.  -->

To configure the SDK for decision management, follow either of two steps below:

## Option 1 - Install the Tag extension and implementation using Launch

This option is more user-friendly for people who may have less coding experience. 

1. [Create a tag property](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/admin/companies-and-properties.html)

1. [Add the embed code](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/core-services-learn/implementing-in-websites-with-launch/configure-launch/launch-add-embed.html)

1. Install and configure Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK extension with the Datastream you created by selecting the configuration from the "Datastream" dropdown. See the documentation on [extensions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/ui/extensions/overview.html).

    ![Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](../../assets/installed-catalog-web-sdk.png)

    ![Configure Extension](../../assets/configure-sdk-extension.png)

1. Create the necessary [Data Elements](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/ui/data-elements.html). At the bare minimum, you must create a Platform Web SDK Identity Map and a Platform Web SDK XDM Object data element.

    ![Identity Map](../../assets/sdk-identity-map.png)

    ![XDM Object](../../assets/xdm-object.png)

1. Create your [Rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/ui/rules.html):

    Add a Platform Web SDK Send Event action and add the relevant decisionScopes to that action's configuration

    ![Render Offer](../../assets/rule-render-offer.png)

    ![Request Offer](../../assets/rule-request-offer.png)

1. [Create and publish](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/publish/libraries.html) a library containing all the relevant Rules, Data Elements, and Extensions you have configured.

## Option 2 - Manually implement using the pre-built stand  alone version

Here are the steps needed to use decision management using the prebuilt standalone installation of the web SDK. This guide assumes this is your first time implementing the SDK, so all of the steps may not be applicable to you. This guide also assumes some development experience.

Include the following JavaScript snippet from Option 2: The Prebuilt Standalone Version on [this page](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/fundamentals/installing-the-sdk.html) in the `<head>` section of your HTML page.

```
javascript
    <script>
        !function(n,o){o.forEach(function(o){n[o]||((n.__alloyNS=n.__alloyNS||
        []).push(o),n[o]=function(){var u=arguments;return new Promise(
        function(i,l){n[o].q.push([i,l,u])})},n[o].q=[])})}
        (window,["alloy"]);
    </script>
    <script src="https://cdn1.adoberesources.net/alloy/2.6.4/alloy.js" async></script>

```

You will need two IDs from within your Adobe account to set up the SDK configuration - your edgeConfigId and your orgId. The edgeConfigId is the same as your Datastream ID, which you should have configured in the Prerequisites. 

To find your edgeConfigID/datastream ID, go to Data Collection and select your Datastream. To find your orgId, go to your profile.

Configure the SDK in JavaScript following the instructions on this page. You will always use your edgeConfigId and orgId in the configuration function. The documentation also describes what optional parameters exist for your configuration. Your final configuration might end up looking something like this:

```
javascript
    alloy("configure", {
        "edgeConfigId": "12345678-0ABC-DEF-GHIJ-KLMNOPQRSTUV",                            
        "orgId":"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW@AdobeOrg",
        "debugEnabled": true,
        "edgeDomain": "edge.adobedc.net",
        "clickCollectionEnabled": true,
        "idMigrationEnabled": true,
        "thirdPartyCookiesEnabled": true,
        "defaultConsent":"in"  
    });

```

Install the Debugger Chrome extension to use with debugging. That can be found here: <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adobe-experience-platform/bfnnokhpnncpkdmbokanobigaccjkpob>

Next, log into your account within the debugger. Then, go to Logs and make sure you are connected to the correct workspace. Now, copy the base64 encoded version of the decision scope from your offer. 

When editing your website, include the script with the configuration and the `sendEvent` function to send the decision scope to Adobe.

**Example**: 

```
javascript
    alloy("sendEvent", {
        "decisionScopes": 
        [
        "eyJ4ZG06YWN0aXZpdHlJZCI6Inhjb3JlOm9mZmVyLWFjdGl2aXR5OjE0ZWE4MDhhZjJjZDM1NzQiLCJ4ZG06cGxhY2VtZW50SWQiOiJ4Y29yZTpvZmZlci1wbGFjZW1lbnQ6MTRjNGFmZDI2OTXXXXXXXXXX"
        ]
    });

```

See the following for an example on how to handle the response:

```
javascript
    alloy("sendEvent", {
        "decisionScopes":
        [
        "eyJ4ZG06YWN0aXZpdHlJZCI6Inhjb3JlOm9mZmVyLWFjdGl2aXR5OjE0ZWE4MDhhZjJjZDM1NzQiLCJ4ZG06cGxhY2VtZW50SWQiOiJ4Y29yZTpvZmZlci1wbGFjZW1lbnQ6MTRjNGFmZDI2OTXXXXXXXXXX"
        ]
    }).then(function(result) {
        Object.entries(result).forEach(([key, value]) => {
            console.log(key, value);
        });
    });

```

You can use the debugger to verify that you have successfully connected to the Edge network. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are not seeing a connection to the edge in the logs, you might need to disable your ad blocker.

Refer back to how you created your offer and the formatting used. Based on the criteria met in the decision, an offer will be returned to you containing the information you specified when creating it within the Adobe Experience Platform.

In this example, the JSON to be returned is:

```
json
{
   "name":"ABC Test",
   "description":"This is a test offer", 
   "link":"https://sampletesting.online/",
   "image":"https://sample-demo-URL.png"
}

```

Handle the response object and parse the data you need. As you can send multiple decision scopes in one `sendEvent` call, your response might look slightly different. 

```
json
    {
        "id": "abrxgl843d913",
        "scope": "eyJ4ZG06YWN0aXZpdHlJZCI6Inhjb3JlOm9mZmVyLWFjdGl2aXR5OjE0ZWE4MDhhZjJjZDM1NzQiLCJ4ZG06cGxhY2VtZW50SWQiOiJ4Y29yZTpvZmZlci1wbGFjZW1lbnQ6MTRjNGFmZDI2OTVlNWRmOSJ9",
        "items": 
        [
            {
                "id": "xcore:fallback-offer:14ea7f1ea26ebd0a",
                "etag": "1",
                "schema": "https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/content-component-json",
                "data": {
                    "id": "xcore:fallback-offer:14ea7f1ea26ebd0a",
                    "format": "application/json",
                    "language": [
                        "en-us"
                    ],
                    "content": "{\"name\":\"ABC Test\",\"description\":\"This is a test offer\", \"link\":\"https://sampletesting.online/\",\"image\":\"https://sample-demo-URL.png\"}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]
}

```

```
json
{
    "propositions": 
    [
    {
        "renderAttempted": false,
        "id": "e15ecb09-993e-4b66-93d8-0a4c77e3d913",
        "scope": "eyJ4ZG06YWN0aXZpdHlJZCI6Inhjb3JlOm9mZmVyLWFjdGl2aXR5OjE0ZWE4MDhhZjJjZDM1NzQiLCJ4ZG06cGxhY2VtZW50SWQiOiJ4Y29yZTpvZmZlci1wbGFjZW1lbnQ6MTRjNGFmZDI2OTVlNWRmOSJ9",
        "items": 
        [
            {
                "id": "xcore:fallback-offer:14ea7f1ea26ebd0a",
                "etag": "1",
                "schema": "https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/content-component-json",
                "data": {
                    "id": "xcore:fallback-offer:14ea7f1ea26ebd0a",
                    "format": "application/json",
                    "language": [
                        "en-us"
                    ],
                    "content": "{\"name\":\"Claire Hubacek Test\",\"description\":\"This is a test offer\", \"link\":\"https://sampletesting.online/\",\"image\":\"https://sample-demo-URL.png\"}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    ]
}

```

In this example, the path needed to handle and use the offer-specific details in the webpage was: `result['decisions'][0]['items'][0]['data']['content']`

To set the JS variables:

```
javascript
const offer = JSON.parse(result['decisions'][0]['items'][0]['data']['content']);

let offerURL = offer['link'];
let offerDescription = offer['description'];
let offerImageURL = offer['image'];

document.getElementById("offerDescription").innerHTML = offerDescription;
document.getElementById('offerImage').src = offerImageURL;

```

<!--## Limitations

Some offer constraints are currently not supported with the mobile Experience Edge workflows, for example Capping. The Capping field value specifies the number of times an offer can be presented across all users. For more details, see [Add constraints to an offer](../../offer-library/add-constraints.md#capping).-->
