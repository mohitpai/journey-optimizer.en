# Create personalized offers {#create-personalized-offers}

Before creating an offer, make sure that you created:

* A **placement** in which the offer will be displayed. See [Create placements](../offer-library/creating-placements.md)
* If you want to add an eligibility condition: a **decision rule** that will define the condition under which the offer will be presented. See [Create decision rules](../offer-library/creating-decision-rules.md).
* One or several **tags** that you may want to associate to the offer. See [Create tags](../offer-library/creating-tags.md).

The list of personalized offers is accessible in the **[!UICONTROL Offers]** menu.
