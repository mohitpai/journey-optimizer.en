# Direct mail configuration {#direct-mail-configuration}

[!DNL Journey Optimizer] allows you to personalize and generate the files required by direct mail providers to send mail to your customers.

When [creating a direct mail message](../direct-mail/create-direct-mail.md), you define the targeted audience data, including the chosen contact information (postal address for example). A file containing this data will then be automatically generated and exported to a server, where your direct mail provider will be able to retrieve it and take care of the actual sending.

Before being able to generate this file, you need to create:

1. A [file routing configuration](#file-routing-configuration) to specify the server where the file will be exported and encrypt the file, if necessary.

    >[!CAUTION]
    >
    >To create a file routing configuration, you need to have the **[!DNL Manage file routing]** built-in permission. [Learn more](../administration/ootb-product-profiles.md#content-library-manager).

1. A [direct mail surface](#direct-mail-surface) that will reference the file routing configuration. If you have not configured any file routing option, you will not be able to create a direct mail surface.

To deliver a direct mail message, [!DNL Journey Optimizer] generates and exports the file containing your targeted audience data to a server.

You need to specify that server details so that your direct mail provider can access and use that file for delivering mail.

To configure the file routing, follow the steps below.

1. Access the **[!UICONTROL Administration]** > **[!UICONTROL Channels]** > **[!UICONTROL File routing configuration]** > **[!UICONTROL File Routing]** menu, then click **[!UICONTROL Create routing configuration]**.

    ![](assets/file-routing-config-button.png){width="800" align="center"}

1. Set a name for your configuration.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Server type]** that you want to use for exporting the direct mail files.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Currently Amazon S3, SFTP and Azure are supported in [!DNL Journey Optimizer].

1. Fill in the details and credentials for your server, such as server address, access key, etc.

    ![](assets/file-routing-config-sftp-details.png)

1. If you selected **[!UICONTROL Amazon S3]**, choose the **[!UICONTROL AWS region]** where the server infrastructure will be located.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >AWS regions are geographic areas that AWS uses to host its cloud infrastructures. As a general practice, it is preferred to choose the region that is closest to you direct mail provider's location.

1. To encrypt the file, copy-paste your encryption key in the **[!UICONTROL PGP/GPG encryption key]** field.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Submit]**. The file routing configuration is created with the **[!UICONTROL Active]** status. It is now ready to be used in a [direct mail surface](#direct-mail-surface).

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can also select **[!UICONTROL Save as draft]** to create the file routing configuration, but you will not be able to select it in a surface until it is **[!UICONTROL Active]**.

To be able to deliver direct mail with [!DNL Journey Optimizer], you need to create a channel surface to define the settings for the formatting of the file that will be used by the mail provider.

A direct mail surface must also include the file routing configuration which defines the server where your direct mail file will be exported.

1. Create a channel surface. [Learn more](../configuration/channel-surfaces.md)

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Direct mail]** channel.

    ![](assets/surface-direct-mail-channel.png){width="800" align="center"}

1. Define the direct mail settings in the dedicated section of the channel surface configuration.

    ![](assets/surface-direct-mail-settings.png){width="800" align="center"}

    <!--![](assets/surface-direct-mail-settings-with-insertion.png)-->

1. Select the file format: **[!UICONTROL CSV]** or **[!UICONTROL Text delimited]**.

1. If you select **[!UICONTROL Text delimited]**, define the column separator of your choice: tabulation, semicolon, pipe, or ampersand.

    ![](assets/surface-direct-mail-column-separator.png)

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL File routing configuration]** amongst the ones that you created. This defines where the file will be exported for your direct mail provider to use.

    >[!CAUTION]
    >
    >If you have not configured any file routing option, you will not be able to create a direct mail surface. [Learn more](#file-routing-configuration)

    ![](assets/surface-direct-mail-file-routing.png){width="800" align="center"}

    <!--![](assets/surface-direct-mail-file-routing-with-insertion.png)-->

1. Submit the direct mail surface.

You can now [create a direct mail message](../direct-mail/create-direct-mail.md) inside a campaign. Once the campaign is started, the file containing the targeted audience data will automatically be exported to the server that you defined. The direct mail provider will then be able to retrieve that file and proceed with the direct mail delivery.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Duplicate rows where all the values in the row are the same are automatically removed from the file.

<!--
    In the **[!UICONTROL Insertion]** section, you can choose to automatically remove duplicate rows.

    Define the maximum number of records (i.e. rows) for each file containing profile data. After the specified threshold is reached, another file will be created for the remaining records.

    ![](assets/surface-direct-mail-split.png)

    For example, if there are 100,000 records in the file and the threshold limit is set to 60,000, the records will be split into two files. The first file will contain 60,000 rows, and the second file will contain the remaining 40,000 rows.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >NOTE You can set any number between 1 and 200,000 records, meaning each file must contain at least 1 row and no more than 200,000 rows.
