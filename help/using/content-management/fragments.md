# Work with fragments {#fragments}

A fragment is a reusable component that can be referenced in one or more emails across [!DNL Journey Optimizer] campaigns and journeys.

This functionality allows to prebuild multiple custom content blocks that can be used by marketing users to quickly assemble email contents in an improved design process.

➡️ [Learn how to manage, author and use fragments in these videos](#video-fragments)

>[!CAUTION]
>
>To create, edit and archive fragments, you must have the **[!DNL Manage Library Items]** permission included in the **[!DNL Content Library Manager]** product profile. [Learn more](../administration/ootb-product-profiles.md#content-library-manager)

To make the best use of fragments:

* Create your own fragments. You can create visual fragments or expression fragments. [Learn more](#create-fragments)
* Use them as many times as needed in your content. See [Add visual fragments](../email/use-visual-fragments.md) and [Leverage expression fragments](../personalization/use-expression-fragments.md)

>[!NOTE]
>
>Currently in [!DNL Journey Optimizer]:
>
>* Visual fragments are only available for the Email channel.
>
>* Expression fragments are not available for the Web and In-app channels.

## Access and manage fragments {#access-manage-fragments}

To access the fragment list, select **[!UICONTROL Content Management]** > **[!UICONTROL Fragments]** from the left menu.

![](assets/fragment-list.png)

All the fragments that were created on the current sandbox - either [from the **[!UICONTROL Fragments]** menu](#create-fragments), either using the [Save as fragment](#save-as-fragment) option - are displayed.

You can filter fragments on their:

* Type: **[!UICONTROL Visual]** or **[!UICONTROL Expression]**
* Tags
* Creation or modification date

You can choose to show all fragments, or only the items that the current user created or modified.

You can also display the **[!UICONTROL Archived]** fragments. [Learn more](#archive-fragments)

![](assets/fragment-list-filters.png)

From the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** button next to each fragment, you can:

* Duplicate a fragment.

* Use the **[!UICONTROL Explore references]** option to see the journeys, campaigns or templates where it is used. [Learn more](#explore-references)

* Copy a fragment to another sandbox. <!--Learn more?-->

* Archive a fragment. [Learn more](#archive-fragments)

* Edit a fragment's [tags](../start/search-filter-categorize.md#tags).

![](assets/fragment-list-more-actions.png)

### Edit fragments {#edit-fragments}

To edit a fragment, follow the steps below.

1. Click the desired item from the **[!UICONTROL Fragments]** list.
1. From the fragment properties, you can [explore references](#explore-references), [manage its access](../administration/object-based-access.md), and update the fragment details including [tags](../start/search-filter-categorize.md#tags).

    ![](../email/assets/fragment-edit-content.png)

1. Select the corresponding button to edit content as you would do when creating a fragment from scratch. [Learn more](#create-from-scratch)

>[!NOTE]
>
>When you edit a fragment, the changes are automatically propagated to all contents using that fragment, except content used in **[!UICONTROL Live]** journeys or campaigns. You can also break inheritance from the original fragment. Learn more in the [Add visual fragments to your emails](../email/use-visual-fragments.md#break-inheritance) and [Leverage expression fragments](../personalization/use-expression-fragments.md#break-inheritance) sections.

### Explore references {#explore-references}

You can display the list of the journeys, campaigns and content templates that are currently using a fragment. 

To do so, select **[!UICONTROL Explore references]** either from the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** menu in the fragment list or from the fragment properties screen.

![](assets/fragment-explore-references.png)

Select a tab to toggle between journeys, campaigns, templates and fragments. You can see their status and click a name to be redirected to the corresponding item where the fragment is referenced.

![](assets/fragment-usage-screen.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the fragment is used in a journey, campaign or template that has a label preventing you from accessing it, you will see an alert message on top of the selected tab. [Learn more on Object Level Access Control (OLAC)](../administration/object-based-access.md)

### Archive fragments {#archive-fragments}

You can clean the fragment list from the items that are no longer relevant to your brand.

To do so, click the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** button next to the desired fragment and select **[!UICONTROL Archive]**. It will disappear from the fragment list, which prevents users from using it in future emails or templates.

![](assets/fragment-list-archive.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you archive a fragment that is used in a content, <!--it will remain in the email or template, but you won't be able to select it from the fragment list to edit it-->that content will not be affected.

To unarchive a fragment, filter on the **[!UICONTROL Archived]** items and select **[!UICONTROL Unarchive]** from the **[!UICONTROL More actions]** menu. It is now again accessible from the fragment list, and can be used in any email or template.

## Create fragments {#create-fragments}

* When designing content, save a portion of your content as fragment. [Learn how](#save-as-fragment)

Once saved, your fragment is available for use in a journey, a campaign or a template. Whether created from scratch or from an existing content, you can now use this fragment when building any content within [!DNL Journey Optimizer].
